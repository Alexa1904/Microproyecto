                <h3 id="titulo">Let me tell you a little bit about my self</h3>

                My main goal at the moment is pass all my subjects successfully and graduate in the stipulated time, sometimes it gets hader than others, but I think if you work hard and persist you will definitely make it

                According to my long-term goals I want to do a Elite Master of Science in Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich wich sets another goal, learning German.
                Once I finish my studies I want to move to the USA and start my life there, if I'm being honest I want to live the famous American Dream.
